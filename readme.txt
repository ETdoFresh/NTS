Type
-----------------------
Ninja-Time Strategy (NTS) is a parody game where a player controls a ninja through real-time strategy looking environments, but instead is played like an action game.

-----------------------
Tools Used
-----------------------
NTS has been created using HTML5 and JavaScript using the WebStorm 8.0.4 IDE. Box2Dweb was used as the physics engine. Sprite sheets were created using TexturePacker. The static “tree” physics areas were created using PhysicsEditor. Most graphics were created using Adobe Illustrator or Photoshop.

-----------------------
Running the Game
-----------------------
The beauty of creating games in HTML5, there is nothing to install. You navigate to the website, click the image, and you are in the game! 
(Note: Tested using Chrome v38 and Internet Explorer v11)

-----------------------
Game Controls
-----------------------
It is recommended that you use a two button mouse. Trackpads may be harder to use.

+ Left Button Click – Move ninja to mouse location
+ Left Button Hold – Continuously move ninja to mouse location
+ Right Click (off ninja) – Throw shuriken
+ Right Click (on ninja) – Take out/Put away sword
+ Enter Key Press – Toggle full screen
+ ‘D’ Key Press – Toggle Physics Debugger

-----------------------
Winning
-----------------------
Each level will consist of a mission objectives given to the player one at a time. These objectives will appear at the bottom of the screen. Complete these objectives until the level is complete.

The “Game Engine” has been created entirely from scratch in JavaScript. Unity’s GameObject hierarchy model was inspiration for how I created this engine. The sites that helped me create the game follow:
